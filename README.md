# llama-go: Run LLMs locally with Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/tcpipuk/llama-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tcpipuk/llama-go)

Go bindings for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), enabling you to run large
language models locally with GPU acceleration. Production-ready library with thread-safe concurrent
inference and comprehensive test coverage. Integrate LLM inference directly into Go applications
with a clean, idiomatic API.

This is an active fork of [go-skynet/go-llama.cpp](https://github.com/go-skynet/go-llama.cpp),
which hasn't been maintained since October 2023. The goal is keeping Go developers up-to-date with
llama.cpp whilst offering a lighter, more performant alternative to Python-based ML stacks like
PyTorch and/or vLLM.

**Documentation**: See [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md),
[building guide](docs/building.md), [API guide](docs/api-guide.md), [examples](examples/README.md),
[Go package docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tcpipuk/llama-go), and
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) for model format and engine details.

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tcpipuk/llama-go
cd llama-go

# Build the library
make libbinding.a

# Download a test model
wget https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf

# Run an example
export LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD C_INCLUDE_PATH=$PWD LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD
go run ./examples/simple -m Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf -p "Hello world" -n 50
```

## Basic usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    llama "github.com/tcpipuk/llama-go"
)

func main() {
    model, err := llama.LoadModel(
        "/path/to/model.gguf",
        llama.WithF16Memory(),
        llama.WithContext(512),
    )
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer model.Close()

    response, err := model.Generate("Hello world", llama.WithMaxTokens(50))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(response)
}
```

When building, set these environment variables:

```bash
export LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD C_INCLUDE_PATH=$PWD LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD
```

## Key capabilities

**Text generation and embeddings**: Generate text with LLMs or extract embeddings for semantic
search, clustering, and similarity tasks.

**GPU acceleration**: Supports NVIDIA (CUDA), AMD (ROCm), Apple Silicon (Metal), Intel (SYCL), and
cross-platform acceleration (Vulkan, OpenCL). Eight backend options cover virtually all modern GPU
hardware, plus distributed inference via RPC.

**Production ready**: Comprehensive test suite with almost 400 test cases and CI validation
including CUDA builds. Active development tracking llama.cpp releases - maintained for production
use, not a demo project.

**Advanced features**: Cache common prompt prefixes to avoid recomputing system prompts across
thousands of generations. Serve multiple concurrent requests with a single model loaded in VRAM (no
weight duplication). Stream tokens as they generate for ChatGPT-style typing effects. Speculative
decoding for 2-3Ã— generation speedup.

## Architecture

The library bridges Go and C++ using CGO, keeping the heavy computation in llama.cpp's optimised
C++ code whilst providing a clean Go API. This minimises CGO overhead whilst maximising
performance.

Key components:

- `wrapper.cpp`/`wrapper.h` - CGO interface to llama.cpp
- Clean Go API with comprehensive godoc comments
- `llama.cpp/` - Git submodule tracking upstream releases

The design uses functional options for configuration, dynamic context pooling for thread safety,
automatic KV cache prefix reuse for performance, resource management with finalizers, and streaming
callbacks via cgo.Handle for safe Go-C interaction.
